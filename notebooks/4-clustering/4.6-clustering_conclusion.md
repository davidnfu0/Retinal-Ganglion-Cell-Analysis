## All stimuli Data Frame

___

The clustering analysis in this dataset, which integrates both Spike-Triggered Average (STA) information and responses to the chirp stimulus, was notable for the effective use of the k-means model. This model excelled in identifying and differentiating clusters based on their unique characteristics.

**Detailed Analysis of STA by Cluster:**

- **Clusters 0 and 2:** These clusters share several characteristics, including similar values of “a” eccentricity, HWHH, and negative peaks. These indicators suggest that both clusters might be composed of OFF-type cells, with pronounced contrast curves. The main difference lies in the bandwidth and zero crossing, being wider in cluster 0, which implies greater variability in its templates.

- **Clusters 1 and 3:** These clusters are characterized by having large bandwidths and low-magnitude negative peaks, suggesting the presence of probably OFF-type cells with less pronounced contrast curves. Although similar, cluster 1 shows less pronounced and narrower contrast curves compared to cluster 3.

- **Cluster 4:** This cluster stands out for mainly incorporating ON-type cells, evident in histograms showing predominantly positive peaks. Grouping all ON-type cells in a single cluster results in greater variability in their characteristics.

The low standard deviation in the characteristics of the first four clusters indicates significant similarity between the templates within each group.

**Analysis of Responses to Chirp Stimulus:**

- **Chirp ON:** Cluster 1 proves to be the most reactive to this stimulus, with a sustained response throughout. Cluster 2 increases its response towards the end of the stimulus. The other clusters show less marked responses, except for specific peaks in certain bins.

- **Chirp OFF:** Similar to the ON stimulus, cluster 1 is the most reactive. Cluster 2 shows an increase in responses at the beginning and end of the stimulus, but does not exceed cluster 1. The other clusters present limited responses, with similar distribution patterns among them.

- **FREQ:** Here, three distinct sectors are observed. Clusters 0, 2, and 4 show similar patterns, with the highest number of responses in the first sector. Clusters 1 and 3 have a different distribution, with sectors positioned differently.

- **AMP:** All clusters show a similar distribution in this sub-stimulus, although clusters 0, 3, and 4 exhibit a lower response rate compared to the others.

## Function Data Frame

___

The clustering analysis conducted on the dataset df_func using the k-means model revealed the existence of seven distinct clusters. This model was chosen for further analysis due to its high performance in both visual inspection and various evaluative metrics.

The df_func dataset is based on the temporal decomposition of Spike-Triggered Averages (STAs), adjusted according to a model proposed in a previous study. Focusing on these values is essential for a deep understanding of the behavior of ganglion cells.

In the contrast vs. time before spike graphs, we see that the templates within the same clusters, especially clusters 6 (brown), 5 (yellow), and 4 (orange), show similar behavior patterns. The spatial representation of the templates also suggests that those with similar positions tend to group in the same cluster, providing an important clue for classification.

**Detailed Analysis of STA by Cluster:**

- **Clusters 0 and 6:** Characterized by having an average Half-Width at Half-Height (HWHH) on the x-axis but negative on the y-axis, corresponding with pronounced negative peaks. This suggests that these clusters might be composed of OFF-type ganglion cells with notable contrast peaks before the spike. Despite similarities, they differ in area, with cluster 0 having a significantly larger area. The high variability in area within cluster 0 suggests a diversity of templates. However, these differences are not enough to consider these clusters as completely distinct groups.

- **Clusters 1 and 5:** These clusters share characteristics such as low eccentricity and area, along with a high but negative HWHH, indicating OFF-type cells with less pronounced contrast peaks. Both clusters have a high bandwidth, suggesting a generally wide contrast curve. The main difference lies in the “a” parameter of their spatial STA, but this does not seem to be a critical distinction. Therefore, it is plausible to consider these clusters as a single homogeneous group of templates.

- **Cluster 2:** Notable for its large average area and high variability in this parameter, implying heterogeneity in the data. It is distinctive for having a positive peak, suggesting it contains ON-type cells, which are less represented in this study. The high variability in its features could be due to the inclusion of all ON-type cells in this cluster.

- **Cluster 3:** Distinguished by having a low zero crossing and a peak similar to clusters 1 and 5, indicating less pronounced contrast curves. This cluster has the highest overall variability and contains a mix of ON and OFF cells.

- **Cluster 4:** Characterized by a high zero crossing and a pronounced contrast curve, similar to clusters 0 and 6.

Although some clusters show high variability in certain features, most exhibit low variability in key attributes, suggesting significant homogeneity within each cluster.

**Analysis of Responses to Chirp Stimulus:**

No significant differences were observed in the responses to the chirp stimulus among the different clusters. This could be due to the absence of chirp stimulus response data in this dataset.

## Only chirp Data Frame

___

This dataframe presents unique challenges for analysis due to the inclusion of a wide variety of templates, some of which do not have STA calculations. This diversity of templates might include repetitions and variations in data quality. Despite these challenges, the k-means model was chosen for its superiority in performance metrics and successfully distinguished six distinct clusters.

**Analysis of Responses to Chirp Stimulus:**

- **Chirp ON:** Cluster 5 stands out with a high average of spikes in most bins, followed by cluster 3. The other clusters show significantly lower averages. Cluster 0, after an initial peak, maintains a low but constant level of spikes. Clusters 1 and 2 have high initial peaks, but decrease considerably afterward. Clusters 3 and 4, although they have initial peaks, are not as pronounced as in clusters 1 and 2.

- **Chirp OFF:** Here, cluster 5 also dominates on average, though it is initially surpassed by cluster 2, which shows higher reactivity at the beginning of the stimulus. The other clusters present lower average amounts of spikes. It is observed that clusters 0 and 2 have high initial peaks, while cluster 3 shows a more uniform distribution and a lower average, indicating less reactivity to this type of stimulus.

- **Chirp FREQ:** Clusters 0, 2, and 5 are the most reactive, showing similar behavior. Cluster 5 includes a template that appears to be an outlier with significantly higher responses, which could affect the average of this cluster. Clusters 1 and 4 are the least reactive.

- **Chirp AMP:** Clusters 1 and 4 again show the least reactivity, with similar patterns. Cluster 0 is the most reactive, followed by clusters 2 and 5, which have a high average of peaks. Cluster 3 is in a middle position.

**General conclusions fo this Data Frame:**

**Clusters 1 and 4 (Combined):**

Given their similarity, Clusters 1 and 4 are considered as a single group. This combined cluster shows consistent characteristics across all sub-stimuli:

- Chirp ON, OFF, FREQ, and AMP: They generally have low reactivity in all sub-stimuli. This suggests that the templates in these clusters are less sensitive to chirp stimuli, which may indicate a specialization in other types of signals or a lower overall reactivity.

**Cluster 0:**

Cluster 0 shows a distinctive response pattern:

- Chirp ON: Shows low reactivity.
- Chirp OFF: Has a high initial peak, followed by a more stable and moderate response.
- Chirp FREQ and AMP: Displays a high level of reactivity, especially in the AMP sub-stimulus, where it leads in responses.
This behavior suggests that Cluster 0 contains templates that are particularly sensitive to certain aspects of OFF and AMP stimuli.

**Cluster 2:**

Cluster 2 is characterized by its intense initial response:

- Chirp ON and OFF: Shows high initial peaks, especially in the OFF sub-stimulus, but then shows a decrease in responses.
- Chirp FREQ: Maintains high reactivity, comparable with Clusters 0 and 5.
- Chirp AMP: Has a good level of reactivity, though it is not the leader in this sub-stimulus.
The response pattern of Cluster 2 suggests high initial sensitivity to stimuli, but with a decreasing responsiveness.

**Cluster 3:**

Cluster 3 shows moderate reactivity:

- Chirp ON and OFF: Has above-average reactivity, with an initial increase in the OFF sub-stimulus.
- Chirp FREQ: Shows consistent performance.
- Chirp AMP: Positions at a medium level of reactivity.
Cluster 3 appears to contain templates that respond in a balanced manner to stimuli, with slightly higher reactivity in the ON and OFF sub-stimuli.

**Cluster 5:**

This cluster stands out for its high reactivity:

- Chirp ON and OFF: Dominates in most bins, showing the highest average of spikes.
- Chirp FREQ: Is one of the most reactive, with an outlier significantly raising its average.
- Chirp AMP: Maintains high reactivity, though it is surpassed by Cluster 0.
Cluster 5 is characterized by a high and constant sensitivity to chirp stimuli, indicating a specialization in detecting these stimuli.
